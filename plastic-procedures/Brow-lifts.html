                            <h2 class="wow fadeInUp" data-wow-delay="0.6s"> BROW LIFT</h2>
                            <div class="wow fadeInUp" data-wow-delay="0.6s">
                                <p> The brow (eyebrows) can be lifted either via scars hidden within the hairline, or alternatively using scars just within the upper hairs of the eyebrows themselves. There are advantages and disadvantages with each. Broadly speaking, the technique using scars within the hair (an endoscopic brow lift), which necessitates the use of a telescope to see inside the forehead and brow area, has the advantage of the scars being hidden within the hair, but the disadvantage that the predictability and elevation of the brow itself might not be as good as desired; whilst the direct brow lift (that leaves a scar within the upper hairs of the eyebrows) has the advantage of more predictability and control of the brow position as well as the possibility of being performed with you awake, but the disadvantage of a potentially more visible scar. They can both be good options, and the choice of which is most suitable should be made during the consultation process with your Purity Bridge Consultant Plastic Surgeon.</p>


                                <p> <b>THE PROCEDURE</b></p>
                                <p>An endoscopic brow lift usually involves 4 or 5 incisions within the hairline. A surgical telescope (the endoscope) is inserted through small incisions (keyhole surgery) to be able to see the inside of your forehead and brow, and under direct vision, the various attachments of your brow are released and mobilised from the inside. Once freed and mobile, your brow is then lifted and stabilised. This is usually by the insertion of a temporary screw (which comes out after about 10-days) through two of the incisions or alternatively by techniques that remain on the inside. </p>

                                <p> A direct brow lift involves the careful removal of a pre-planned crescent of skin from just above the eyebrow. This is usually between a third to two thirds of the distance from the outermost part of the brow, and does not usually involve the inner third. The skin is carefully removed, the eyebrow is freed up from its deep attachments and then the skin is carefully stitched closed.</p>

                                <p> <b>WHAT DOES IT INVOLVE?</b></p>
                                <p>An endoscopic brow lift is performed under a general anaesthetic (with you asleep) either on its own, or often in combination with other procedures such as upper eyelid surgery. It may be done as a day case (in and out the same day) or if with other procedures, with you staying in hospital, depending on the nature of the other procedures. </p>

                                <p> A direct brow lift is normally performed under local anaesthetic, again either as an isolated procedure, or often in combination with an upper eyelid lift. You are normally able to leave the clinic shortly after the procedure.</p>

                                <p> <b>WHAT ARE THE BENEFITS?</b></p>
                                <p>Both brow lifts elevate and stabilise the brow, which inevitably lowers over time (with the ageing process), alleviating the tired or sad look that may have developed from the heaviness of the lower brow. During an endoscopic brow lift, sometimes the frown muscles can also be weakened in addition to the lifting of your brow. </p>

                                <p> <b>HOW LONG DOES THE SURGERY TAKE?</b></p>
                                <p>An endoscopic brow lift alone takes 60-90 minutes, whilst the direct brow lift takes around 45-minutes to perform.</p>

                                <p> <b> WHAT IS THE RECOVERY PERIOD? </b></p>
                                <p>Following an endoscopic brow lift, it is common to experience some headache in the forehead region after the surgery. You will have some swelling and bruising afterwards, which will fade after 1-2 weeks following surgery and the scars heal quickly. The clips/stitches in the hairline are removed at 10-14 days after the surgery. </p>

                                <p>After a direct brow lift, the stitches are removed 1-week following surgery, and occasionally, further surgical tapes are placed to support the wounds. There may be some bruising after a direct brow lift that can drift down to the eyelid area.</p>

                                <p><b>HOW LONG BEFORE DAILY ACTIVITIES MAY BE RESUMED?</b></p>
                                <p>After either procedure, rest is advised initially, and you should sleep with 2 or 3 pillows initially so your head is elevated - this will help the swelling resolve. During the first week you should avoid straining and bending down as this tends to increase swelling. Most people are ready to go out and return to work by about 2-weeks, but it is usually 3-4 weeks before you will be ready for major social events. Strenuous activity should be avoided for at least 4-weeks. Contact lenses should not be worn for 2-weeks after a brow lift. </p>

                                <p><b>WHAT ARE THE SUCCESS RATES?</b></p>
                                <p>Endoscopic brow lifts have a good success rate and they are considered the gold standard surgery for rejuvenating the forehead and lifting the brows to give an open appearance and fresh look the upper third of the face, which are characteristics of youth and beauty. One challenge in some individuals is that, due to the lifting and anchoring being some distance away from the eyebrow itself (in the hairline), some of the effect of the traction of the pull is lost over the distance to the brow. This means that in some people the elevation of the brow is not maintained as well over time. This is more likely in those with poorer quality skin, those with loose skin or those with strong forehead muscles. Should the brow re-descend, the options might be to redo the brow lift or decide to perform a direct brow lift (revision procedures would be at further cost).</p>

                                <p>A direct brow lift also has good success rates. The main challenge with direct brow lifts is the final quality of the scar. This can vary between individuals. In most people the scar ends up as a faint silvery line sitting at the level of the upper border of the eyebrow hairs. In some, however, the scar can widen or thicken, necessitating further treatment or revision surgery (again, this would be at further cost).</p>

                                <p><b>WHAT ARE THE POSSIBLE COMPLICATIONS?</b></p>
                                <p>For either procedure, complications can include wound problems, such as infection and slow healing, as well as bleeding from the wound on occasion. There may be a small degree of asymmetry between the two sides. Transient numbness to the forehead and scalp is to be expected for a few weeks after the procedure. Whilst every care is taken to close the wounds meticulously, scarring is variable between individuals, and the quality of the final scar can only be determined over time. Occasionally there can be more bruising than expected but this usually settles uneventfully. </p>
                                <p> For endoscopic brow lifts, there can uncommonly be damage to some sensory and possibly motor nerves. In the worst-case scenario (which is fortunately rare) there can be impairment of brow movement after the operation, and possible permanent numbness to the forehead and scalp. Occasionally a small amount of hair loss in the region of the incisions is seen, but this usually recovers with time. </p>
