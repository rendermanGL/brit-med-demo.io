                            <h2 class="wow fadeInUp" data-wow-delay="0.6s"> PURITY BRIDGE FACELIFT</h2>
                            <div class="wow fadeInUp" data-wow-delay="0.6s">

                                <p>At Purity Bridge, we recognise the wide variation in people's faces and how we all age differently. There is no one-size fits all facelift, and the right procedure has to be chosen for the right person, at the right time.</p>


                                <p> <b>THE PROCEDURE</b></p>
                                <p>We have developed a local anaesthetic facelift (The Purity Bridge Facelift) that is specifically aimed at targeting the development of mild and moderate jowls, and is performed under a local anaesthetic in the clinic. It is a SMAS lift (so the main lift is performed on the deeper tissues) which produces a more natural and longer lasting result.</p>

                                <p>The Purity Bridge Facelift is performed with you awake, under local anaesthetic alone (no need for sedation), with the aim being to restore a refreshed and natural jawline and cheek contour. Patients are able to walk out of the clinic after the procedure with no dressings, no bandages and no drains.</p>

                                <p>Your jawline will feel tight after the procedure, and there are specific instructions that we will give you, but the downtime is less than for a more comprehensive face/neck lift meaning you need to take less time off work, and are able to get on with your life sooner.</p>

                                <p> <b>WHAT DOES IT INVOLVE?</b></p>
                                <p> The procedure will be performed in our Purity Bridge operating theatre. Our Consultant Plastic Surgeon will carefully draw specific markings on your face to plan for the surgery. Once you are comfortable lying down, gentle local anaesthetic injections will be administered slowly. These will sting initially but will soon make your cheek and face numb.
                                    The scars are carefully placed around the sideburn area and hug the natural creases at the front of the ear. The scars will also go behind the ear for a variable distance depending on the patient. 
                                    The skin is incised and then carefully lifted from the underlying tissue (known as the SMAS). Once the skin is sufficiently feed, the SMAS is then lifted and restored to its higher position with internal stitches. Having repositioned the SMAS, the skin is gently redraped and trimmed to allow it to be neatly sewn creating subtle scars
                                </p>


                                <p> <b>WHAT ARE THE BENEFITS?</b></p>
                                <p>The Purity Bridge Facelift avoids the need to go to hospital for surgery. There are no bandages or drains and the recovery is quick. You are able to walk out of the clinic after the procedure (accompanied by a friend or relative) and go straight home.</p>

                                <p> <b>HOW LONG DOES THE SURGERY TAKE?</b></p>
                                <p>The surgery typically takes around 3 hours to perform (just over an hour each side, plus time for the injections)</p>

                                <p> <b> WHAT IS THE RECOVERY PERIOD? </b></p>
                                <p>You will return a week later for most of the stitches to be removed, with some remaining stitches removed the following week. We have determined the best type of stitches to leave the most inconspicuous scar are the ones that need to be removed. Most people are able to go back to work in 7-10 days and any bruising has usually settled down by this time.</p>
                               

                                <p><b>HOW LONG BEFORE DAILY ACTIVITIES MAY BE RESUMED?</b></p>
                                <p>Most people are able to exercise by around a month after surgery. We do not advise exercising before this time or lifting heavy objects</p>

                                <p><b>WHAT ARE THE SUCCESS RATES?</b></p>
                                <p>The Purity Bridge Facelift has high success rates and high patient satisfaction. It is important that you are properly assessed by our Consultant Plastic Surgeons to ensure you are the right sort of candidate for the procedure, to give you the best chance of achieving a good result. </p>
                               
                                
                                <p><b>WHAT ARE THE POSSIBLE COMPLICATIONS?</b></p>
                                <p>As with any surgical procedures, there are risks that can be associated with this procedure. We will ensure the risk of complications is kept to a minimum and that you have 24-hour access to our surgeons. The risks include bleeding (which may require further surgery), wound infection, poor scarring (which might require further treatment and cost), asymmetry, seroma, recurrence of sagging sooner than expected if you have poor skin quality, very rarely injury to the facial nerve, numbness to the cheek skin (usually temporary)</p>
